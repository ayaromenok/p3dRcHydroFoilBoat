## Introduction

Hydrofoil boat (called "Meteor" in tribute of Rostislav Alexeev hydrofoil ship) with trimaran structure and differentional trust mix props.
Impelented in OpenSCAD. To rebuild STL's required [p3d Lib2 0.2.2.20210615](https://github.com/ayaromenok/p3dLib)

## Status - on hold<a name="on_hold"></a>

Due to instability of boat in hydrofoil mode current development is put on hold. New ideas about form of wing required

## v0.3.0 <a name="v0_3_0"></a>

- Version from 2021.08.20

### Issues
  - stability issues in hydrofoil mode
  - CoPET printed floats not hydroscopic

## v0.2.0 <a name="v0_2_0"></a>

- Version from 2021.07.23

### Issues    
  - support float/hydrofoil connetors need to be higher(affected by water)
  - line of support floats and engine should be in one line (spray affected props)
  - front connectors should be stronger
  - front floats should be installed in 10-15 degree
  - front wing can be bigger
  - camera connector should be mounted a top of the engine wings and be strong
  - nose gunwale(falschbort) should be much higher for strong wind situation

## v0.1.1 <a name="v0_1_1"></a>

- Version from 2021.07.18

### Issues
  - waterproofness of right support float (printing issue)
  - small support floats [issue #8](https://github.com/ayaromenok/p3dRcHydroFoilBoat/issues/8)
  - support floats should be moved forward [issue #9](https://github.com/ayaromenok/p3dRcHydroFoilBoat/issues/9)
  - fuselage strength and connection need to be revisioned [issue #10](https://github.com/ayaromenok/p3dRcHydroFoilBoat/issues/10)
  - support for Jetson Nano carrier board required (wider fuselage required) [issue #10](https://github.com/ayaromenok/p3dRcHydroFoilBoat/issues/10)
  - support for Raspberry Pi required [issue #10](https://github.com/ayaromenok/p3dRcHydroFoilBoat/issues/10)
